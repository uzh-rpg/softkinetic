softkinetic
===========

This repository holds a ROS driver package for an interactive gesture camera
(softkinetic).


Status
------

New users should try the `indigo_dev` branch of this repository, it contains
many improvements that are currently being readied for release. Despite the
name, this version should also work on Hydro installations.

The `hydro_dev` branch is maintained separatedly, as both branches have notably
diverged. Some topic and parameters names are different, so they are not compatible.
